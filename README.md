Copy files to local disc and start with [start.html](./start.html). Enjoy the game.

## Disclaimer
Before you start I want point out important notes:
* UI is terrible, because there isn't any.
* There is not tutorial or guide, so you may feel lost.
* Before this game you should end Dark Souls 1 first, then it will become like walk in the park.
